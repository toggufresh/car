Add __init__.py, my_dao.py and my_services.py into flask-mvc-example/projects/controllers/----HERE----...

server.py should be added in flask-mvc-example that you probably have.

Guide to start (macOS), in order:
start server.py
source venv/bin/start
cd project
cd controllers
flask run

Add URI, username and password to your Neo4j account to access your database, and test it using Postman.
